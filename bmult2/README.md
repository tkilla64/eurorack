This is a dual 1-to-2 buffered multiple that can be used as a 1-to-4 buffered mult if the second input is unconnected. The inputs are terminated to GND using 100k resistors and the output drivers compensate for the input load of the connected module.

### Inputs
Two inputs. Second input is normalled to the first one. 100k pulldown resistors.

### Outputs
Two outputs connected to each input.

### Supply
+12 VDC @ 1 mA  
-12 VDC @ 1 mA

### Dimensions
Height: 3U  
Width: 2HP  
Depth: 23 mm
